# Deep-Learning-Chatbot
DEVELOPING A CHATBOT VIRTUAL ASSISTANT FOR TRAINING STUDENTS

  Neural networks are an important paradigm in the field of machine learning and are successfully used in many domains, from object recognition in images to natural language processing and the development of robots.
  
  In this scientific research, we will build a chatbot virtual assistant using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on a dataset that contains categories (intentions), patterns (questions), and responses. We will use a special recurrent neural network, a special field of deep learning, to classify which category the user's message belongs to, and then we will give a random response from the corresponding list of responses.
